# Weather Forecast Script üå°Ô∏è 
This Python script retrieves the weather forecast for the next 7 days using the Weatherbit API based on the user's input location. The script can print the forecast in a tabular format or save it to a file.


## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Requests library (pip install requests)


## Usage
- Obtain an API key from Weatherbit by signing up for a free account.
- Insert your API key into the api_key variable in the script.
- Run the script using the command python weather_forecast.py.
- Enter the location for which you want to retrieve the weather forecast when prompted.
- The script will fetch the forecast, display it on the console, and save it to a file named forecast_location.txt.


## Example Output
Enter a location: New York

- The API key provided in the script is for demonstration purposes only. It is recommended to use your own API key.
